    <h2>Hi, I'm Dmitriy ðŸ‘‹</h2>
    <p>
        A few details about myself - I'm a beginner developer. I've always been curious about how things work. That's why I decided to dive into the world of code. If I don't know how to do it - I will look for an answer to that question. If I lack information, I will find it and learn it. I donâ€™t have any commercial projects yet- only educational ones, but I have a desire to learn, develop and work hard.
